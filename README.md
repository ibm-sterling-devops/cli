## Introduction

This Code is inspired by on [IBM Maximo Application Suite CLI Utility](https://ibm-mas.github.io/cli/)

There are minimal dependencies to meet on your own computer to use the CLI:

- Bash (v4)
- Python
- Ansible
- OpenShift client
- IBMCloud client with container plugin enabled
- Network access to the OpenShift cluster



The engine that performs all tasks is written in Ansible, you can directly use the same automation outside of this CLI if you wish.  The code is open source and available in [ibm-sterling-devops/ansible-ibm-sterling](https://github.com/ibm-sterling-devops/ansible-ibm-sterling).
